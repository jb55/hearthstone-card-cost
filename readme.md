# hearthstone-card-cost

  Hearthstone card cost predictor

## Installation

  Install with npm

    $ npm install hearthstone-card-cost

## Accuracy

  This was generated from a linear model taking most card properties into
  account.  Some cards such as spells should use attack as their damage value.
  AOE effects are not yet modelled.

  Cards that have special effects are not modelled, such as Molten Giant. These
  cards can have a prediction error of >2 mana. If you take a random card in
  hearthstone, this model will give you a correct answer about `50%` of the
  time.  It's correct within `Â± 1` mana roughly `80%` of the time.

  After I get a better dataset, I will be able to update the model to better
  reflect the special effects.

## Example

```js
var predict = require('hearthstone-card-cost')

// Predict Al'Akir!
var cost = predict({ 
  attack: 3,
  health: 5,
  taunt: 1,
  charge: 1,
  divineShield: 1,
  windfury: 1
})

// predicted cost === 6
// Al'Akir is overpriced!
```

## API
